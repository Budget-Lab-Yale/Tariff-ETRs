# Three levels of specificity (highest precedence last):
# 1. Headline rates (default for all GTAP sectors)
# 2. Product rates (HTS code-based overrides)
# 3. Product x country rates (most specific)

  china: 0.2
  canada: 0.35
  mexico: 0.25
  japan: 0.15
  uk: 0.1
  eu: 0.15

# which were folded into ftrow and row respectively. This is no longer used.
# Korea is now directly mapped to ftrow and Vietnam to row in the country mapping.
